# A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Mood-Driven Song Recommendations
Overview
This project introduces a hybrid deep learning model that combines computer vision and emotion analysis to recommend songs based on user mood. By capturing a user's facial expressions, the model predicts their emotional state and suggests songs to enhance their mood. The application aims to create a seamless and personalized music recommendation experience.

Features
Emotion Detection: Uses deep learning to analyze facial expressions and identify emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.).
Mood-Based Song Recommendation: Suggests songs tailored to the detected mood.
User-Friendly Interface: A web-based platform to upload pictures and view recommendations.
Multi-Emotion Support: Handles various emotions, including happy, sad, neutral, surprise, angry, and disgust.

Tech Stack
Front-End
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript: For designing a responsive and interactive user interface.
Angular or React.js: Framework for building the application.
Back-End
Python (Flask/Django): Backend server to handle requests and integrate the deep learning model.
REST APIs: For communication between the front-end and back-end.
Deep Learning
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the emotion detection model.
OpenCV: For processing facial images.
Pretrained Models: Optionally used for transfer learning, e.g., VGG16 or ResNet
